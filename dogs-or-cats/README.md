# Dogs or Cats Image Classification
In this project, I classify the image as whether it is the image of dog or that of a cat by using Deep Learning. I would be using Python 3, Keras on top of Tensorflow and Kaggle Data from Challenge [Dogs vs Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition)

# MNIST Digit Recognition on Google Colab
In this project, I used Google Colab to build a model for digit recognition using Keras on top of Tensorflow. I used Python 3
and GPU acceleration provided by Colab for this project. If you want to run it yourself, just import the file on your Drive and open
with Colab. You need to have your api key of Kaggle to download the data to the Colab. You can obtain your Kaggle Api key by following instructions [here](https://github.com/kaggle/kaggle-api)

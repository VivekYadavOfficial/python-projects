## Squeeze and Excitation Network Inception Network implementation using Keras in Python

In this project, I implemented the Squeeze and Excitation network with Inceotion module using Keras in Python with Tensorflow as backend. I coded the whole architecture from scratch. The code has explaination using the comments. One can easily understand the code if experienced with the Deep Learning basics and have knowledge of working of Convolution Neural Networks. To understand the concept behind, read the original paper by author of SENet [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01507.pdf)
